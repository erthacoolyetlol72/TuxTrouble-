left_flip:P_Beastie2:Ah! Look who’s arrived!
left_flip:P_Beastie:Early as well. 
right_flip:P_BF3:Beep.
left_flip:P_Beastie:Welcome to Ravenbridge Mansion.
left_flip:P_Beastie:Thanks for coming on such short notice you two, I really needed a replacement musician for this party after what happened with Audacity Girl.
right_flip:P_BF2:Bop?
left_flip:P_Beastie3:Nevermind that, there’s more important matters to deal with. 
left_flip:P_Beastie:As you can tell, the guests haven’t arrived yet and I’ve barely even started decorating, so we still have quite a bit of time left until Tux’s birthday party. 
right_flip:P_BF:Bap.
left_flip:P_Beastie:If you want, we can run a little practice song before everyone gets here. Loosen up those vocal cords a bit, y’know? 
right_flip:P_BF3:Beep!
left_flip:P_Beastie4:Alright! Somebody lay down a beat!
